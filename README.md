# Java Student Grade Manager

A console-based Java application built to refresh and demonstrate core
programming fundamentals, including object-oriented programming, arrays,
input validation, and menu-driven program flow.

## Overview
This project simulates a simple student grade management system. Users can
add students, view stored records, search by student ID, and calculate the
class average. The application was designed with clarity and clean structure
in mind to reinforce foundational Java concepts.

## Features
- Menu-driven console interface
- Add and store student records
- Display all students
- Search for a student by ID
- Calculate average grade
- Input validation to prevent invalid data

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, encapsulation)
- Arrays and loops
- Method decomposition
- Conditional logic and switch statements
- User input handling and validation
- Separation of concerns
